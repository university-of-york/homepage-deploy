# Deploying homepage changes

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/university-of-york/homepage-deploy/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/university-of-york/homepage-deploy)

## One-off setup

__Install NodeJS, Git and PhantomJS__  
If you don't already have them, download them directly or via your favourite package manager.

* __Install Grunt__  
To install Grunt, type:
`npm install -g grunt-cli`  
*You may find that this is a lot less straightforward than it looks on managed Windows machines.*

* __Clone the respository__  
`git clone https://github.com/university-of-york/homepage-deploy.git homepage-deploy`

* __Install dependencies__  
From your local clone of the repository, run:
`npm install`.

* __Populate login details__  
In the root of the repository, create a file called .ftppass, paste in the code below and replace the username and password values. If you do not know them, please ask someone from the Digital team.

## Day-to-day usage

### Step 1: Make your changes in Contentful

See the [documentation in the SMDC wiki](https://wiki.york.ac.uk/display/SMDC/Homepage+publishing+with+Contentful) for further details.

### Step 2: Preview your changes

Make sure that the _publish on..._ field for the current content is set to `Generate a preview`.

From your local copy of the repository, run `grunt` to launch the build task.

This will get the current content from Contentful, incorporate it into index.shtml in the 'upload' folder, and SFTP the result to [http://www.york.ac.uk/static/data/homepage/](http://www.york.ac.uk/static/data/homepage/).

A notification will be sent to the [homepage_publishing Slack channel](https://uoy.slack.com/archives/GUGJZ9F8S) on success, or if an error occurs.

### Step 3: Deploy to live

Make sure that the _publish on..._ field for the current content is set to `Deploy to live`.

From your local copy of the repository, run `grunt` to launch the build task.

Once the changes are live, a screenshot of the homepage will be taken and stored in [http://www.york.ac.uk/np/screenshots](http://www.york.ac.uk/np/screenshots).

A notification will be sent to the [homepage_publishing Slack channel](https://uoy.slack.com/archives/GUGJZ9F8S) on success, or if an error occurs.

## Making changes to the homepage template

If changes are needed to parts of the homepage which aren't built by the content from Contentful (recent examples included the inclusion of a the _Cookies_ link in the footer and the addition of tabs to the course search box), you should edit the [homepage layout](./layouts/homepage.html) and/or its dependencies in the layout directory.

âš  Commit messages to this repo should include the text `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` to ensure that our CI platform, [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/), doesn't automatically run the build task and accidentally update the homepage.
